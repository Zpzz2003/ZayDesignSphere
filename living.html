  <h2>Types of Retirement Homes</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Independent Living Communities:</strong> Best for seniors who can live on their own but want access to assistance when needed.</li>
    <li><strong>Assisted Living Facilities:</strong> Great for seniors who need help with daily activities such as bathing, dressing, and medication management.</li>
    <li><strong>Nursing Homes:</strong> Provide medical care and supervision for seniors with serious health conditions.</li>
    <li><strong>Continuing Care Retirement Communities (CCRCs):</strong> Offer a combination of all levels of care, from independent living to nursing care, all in one location.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Choosing the right retirement home depends on your health, lifestyle preferences, and budget. It's important to tour several facilities and talk to residents before making a decision.</p>
